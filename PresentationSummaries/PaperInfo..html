A Samsung S21 mobile is used to take nail photos from preterm infants’ six anatomic regions (left and right
fingernail, toe nail, and palm) at NICU bedside.

Study nurse takes infant nail pictures in NICU bedside using a smart phone,
identify a region of interest (a rectangle) on the picture. The phone app converts pixel intensities into numerical values for color

weeks of life during their stay in the NICU).

We describe SAS 9.4 code to manage and merge these files to create analytic
datasets.   These datasets are further merged with infant longitudinal characteristics variables that are saved in a separate
database.

<td class="l data" style=" font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14pt;">Last observation carried forward (LOCF) is a ubiquitous method of imputing missing values in longitudinal studies, and is
commonly implemented when a subject (i.e., a patient or participant) misses a scheduled visit, and data cannot be collected (or
generated). In general, the last “valid” value from a previous visit is retained for the later visit on which the data could not be
obtained, and this conservative estimation succeeds in cases where the actual value would have been little changed. Nuanced
criteria may stipulate which prior values count as “valid” (e.g., after the start of treatment) as well as for how long (e.g., how
many days, visit weeks, consecutive missed visits) a value can be used to impute other values. Given these complexities,
LOCF solutions implemented in SAS® historically adopt a procedural approach, and often require multiple DATA steps and/or

R&#39;s lazy evaluation is driven by a data structure called Promise, which postpones
evaluation and does not occupy memory until the value is needed, utilizing a call-by-need strategy. SAS, on the other hand,
achieves lazy evaluation through its symbol tables, employing memory to store parameters, and operates on a call-by-name

functions retrieve values and “setter” functions initialize (or modify) variables. In Java, for example, getters and setters are
constructed as conduits to private classes, and facilitate data encapsulation by restricting variable access. Conversely, the
SAS® language lacks classes, so SAS global macro variables are typically utilized to maintain and access data across multiple

however, SAS maintains only one global symbol table in which global macro variables can be maintained. Additionally,

<td class="l data" style=" font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14pt;">Creating high-quality, reproducible training materials for technical instruction can be time-consuming and complex. This
presentation introduces a streamlined workflow that integrates SAS, GitHub, and Overleaf to automate many aspects of the
generation and management of instructional documents, with a focus on reproducibility, version control, and collaborative
editing.
Participants will explore how custom SAS code can be used to convert analytical outputs and code snippets into
LaTeX-compatible formats, enabling seamless integration with Overleaf for professional-quality documentation. The workflow
also incorporates custom LaTeX style files to ensure consistency and clarity across materials. GitHub serves as the backbone
for version control and collaboration, allowing instructors to manage updates, track changes, and share materials with students
or co-authors efficiently.
This session will include live demonstrations and interactive components, allowing attendees to
engage with the tools as learners. By the</td>

<td class="l data" style=" font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14pt;">Software interoperability describes the ability of software systems, components, and languages to communicate effectively with
each other, and must be prioritized in today’s multilingual and open-source development environments. PROC FCMP, the
SAS® Function Compiler, enables Python functions to be wrapped in (and called from) SAS user-defined functions (and
subroutines), and the full panoply of SAS environments supports FCMP—including SAS Display Manager, SAS Enterprise
Guide, SAS Studio, SAS Viya, and the latest Cary show pony, SAS Workbench. Productivity and the pace of development are
maximized when existing open-source code—such as Python user-defined functions—can be run natively from a Python
interactive development environment (IDE) rather than having to be needlessly recoded into the Base SAS language. This text
demonstrates SAS and Python user-defined functions that collaboratively call the Google Maps Platform APIs to geocode
street addresses into latitude/longitude coordinates, and to calculate dri</td>

<td class="l data" style=" font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14pt;">Scatter plots and bar charts are part of the package, but what sets this paper apart are ways to use PROC SGMAP and ODS
HTML5 that have never been seen before. Inherent practical difficulties in using choropleth maps (i.e., maps that have
countries color-coded based on response value: population, case count, mortality count, case rate, or mortality count) have
been overcome.

To programmatically color the country areas is NOT a problem. Seeing the color coding CAN BE. Even
FINDING a tiny country on a map is always a challenge. The range of the world&#39;s land areas includes 2 sq. mi. (0.8 sq. km.) for
Monaco. On a web-enabled map, if you cannot find a country, you cannot raise its mouseover text. In this presentation, you will
see the solution.

My actually usable web-enabled atlas for COVID-19 includes maps for the world and for each continent
except Antarctica. To make the broad expanse of Asia more easily explorable, there are five regional maps. There are also
maps for the Central America mainland and the Ca</td>
